ESP32 Solar Tracker. This project is an IoT-based solar tracker using an ESP32 microcontroller. It automatically adjusts the position of a solar panel using four LDRs and a servo motor to maximize sunlight exposure. The system also measures voltage, current, power, and temperature, and uploads this data to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.
